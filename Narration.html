<pre style="font-size: 27px; padding-left: 20px">
  Narration is basically known as Speech. Here the speakers are important 
  that which one is saying and which one is listening at a perticular 
  time.
        Here, Speech is divided into two types on the basis of speaker and 
        listner. 
  They are :  
            1.Direct Speech 
            2.Indirect Speech 
  For Example : He says to me ,"I am busy".(Direct Speech) 
                He tells me that He is busy.(Indirect speech) 

  <b>* Note</b> : narration is nothing but <b>SPEECH</B>

  <b>* Basically Speech is of two types.</b>
    
  <b>1. Direct Speech</b> : Direct speech is that sentence which is
                     spoken for the first time by first person.
                     Here , the first person is the speaker and
                     the second person is listner.

  Example : He says to me ( Reported verb ),"He invites you"
            ( Reported speech ). ( Direct Speech )                    

  <B>2. Indirect Speech</B> : When the same sentence is repeated by the
                       second person is called the Indirect speech.
                       Here , the second person is the speaker and
                       the third person is the listner.      
    
  Example : He says to me that he invites me. ( Indirect Speech )
